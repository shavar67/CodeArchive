/*
  The bridge design pattern
  Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently
  progressively adding functionality while separating out major differences using abstract classes.

  when you want to be able to change both the abstraction and concrete classes independently
  when you want the first abstract class to define rules
  the concrete class adds additional rules
  an abstract class has a reference to the device and it defines
  abstract methods that will be defined
  the concrete remote defines the abstract methods required
